Like most restaurants have one or two vegetarian and vegan option, every community
should have a \emph{MedFree} option.\nl
\textbf{MedFree} - Participation does not require mandatory medical interventions, including invasive tests.\nl
\emph{A goal of this conference is to put such an option ``on the menu'' of the zero-knowledge community.}

 First conceived in 1985, zk-proofs lived mainly in theory papers for 30 years.\nl
 In the last decade, they've become more practical, and a multititude of companies are writing zkp software.\nl
 \textcolor{blue}{Many consider zk-snarks, a type of zkp, \textbf{the} tool for blockchain privacy and scalability solutions. Hence, the zk community heavily overlaps with several blockchain communities like Ethereum.}

 Let's go back in history 20 years and talk about Vioxx (we're all sick of talking about covid, right?) \nl
 \textcolor{blue}{..but let's stop and talk about Theranos one sec..

 \frametitle{Vioxx}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Developed by Merck for arthritis; approved in 1999.
  \item Used by 25 million Americans.
  \item Last year on market - 2.5 Billion usd in revenue.\pause
  
  \item \textcolor{red}{Sept 2004 - taken off market after study showing it doubles risk of heart attack and stroke.}
  \item estimated deaths caused: 40,000 - 60,000  \emph{``..roughly the number of American soldiers who died in the Vietnam War''}.\pause
\item 2007 - Merck pays 4.85 Bil to settle civil suit of 27k plaintiffs claiming Vioxx caused their storke/heart attack.
\item 2011 - Merck pays another 1B to settle other allegations.
 \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
 \stitle{How it began:}\\
 NSAIDs (Ibuprofen,Naproxen,..)
 \begin{itemize}
  \item 
 Work by inhibiting an enzyme called Cyclooxygenase (COX). Results in reduction of pain, inflammation, fever.\nl
 \item But since COX protects the stomach lining, this inhibition can cause GI/stomach problems, at worst case a \emph{hole} in your colon (perforated ulcer).
 \end{itemize}

 
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
 \stitle{The COX-2 hypothesis}
 Scientists discovered COX has two forms
 \begin{itemize}
  \item COX-1 protects lining of stomach.
  \item COX-2 leads to inflammation.\nl
 \end{itemize}
So let's develop drugs that only inhibit COX-2!\nl
\emph{The catch:} COX-1 and COX-2 balance each other in vascular system.COX-1 makes blood clots more likely, COX-2 opens blood vessels, makes them less likely.

 \begin{itemize}
  \item Bank sells for 1\$ pairs of bonds ($A$,$B$), e.g. signifying two candidates in an election.\pause
  \item After elections bank buys back bond of winning candidate for $1\$ $.\pause
  \item During election people trade these two bond types  on the free market - their price gives a prediction of 
  election result from people with \emph{skin in the game}

 \begin{itemize}
  \item In beginning of year, bank sells for 1\$ pairs of bonds $(P,N)$.

 \frametitle{Conditional Prediction markets}
\begin{itemize}
 \item We have a future event $E$, e.g. $E=$ ``brexit bill will pass''.\pause
 \item Bank sells for 1\$ a pair of bonds $(P_E,N_E)$.\pause
 \item If $E$ didn't happen, bank reimburses a dollar to buyers of bond pairs.\pause
 \item IF $E$ did happen - as before bank redeems $P_E$ for $ACW$ dollars and $N_E$ for $1-ACW$ dollars.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
 \frametitle{Governing in democracy DAO/futarchy}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Given proposed law $L$, we start two conditional prediction markets - one with event $E=$``L was passed'',
  the other with event $F=$``L didn't pass''.\pause
  \item If after a while $P_E$ is worth more on the market than $P_F$, we pass the law; otherwise we don't.
